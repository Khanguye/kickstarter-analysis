### Chalenge

1. Data analysis of the Category “Theater” based on date

Limitation: The uneven distribution data of May and June when comparing the successful ledged from country to country. The most successful legdged data of May and June belongs to United States and Great Britain. This is very difficult to analyze the successful ledged campaigns for other countries because the data is very minimal for the countries out of United States and Great Britain.

Conclusion: If you plan to run the funding campaigns in the theater categrory and specially in Untited States and Great Britain, you should do the funding campaign between May and June. The worst time for funding were between November and December only 91 successful. The failed pledged numbers were the same for all months around 40 and 50. And also the canceled pledged numbers were 3 or 4 each month. The reason failed and canceled numbers may be asked high fundings or regions. Therefore, May and June are good months to do the theater category funding campaign.


2. Louise’s play Fever came close came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. 
How many other Kickstarter campaigns were able to do this as well? In this challenge, 
you’ll conduct a data analysis to answer this question and determine whether the length of a campaign contributes to its ultimate success or failure.

Limitation: Data is limited to countries in aggregate, and this prevents being able to analyze each country as a separate entity. In order to do so, we would need to know where in each country the data was collected from ie urban areas and regions

![Number Days of Successful Outcome Stat](/NumberDaysOfSuccessfulOutComes.png)

Conclusion:   Louise’s play Fever should do the funding campaign for $5,000 or less because the successful pledged or funded more 72%. The average days to run successful campaign is about 30 days based on the Number days of Successful OutComes. However, the duration may be longer than 30 days becuase there a lot of outliers over 40 days. The Average Donations of successful outcomes said that people are conformtable to pledge in this play subcatergory about $62. The chart aslo have a lot of outliers so it should be have some suprised to meet the goal earlier or funded more than the goal.
