### Chalenge

1. Data analysis of the Category “Theater” based on date

Data Limition: The Data were included all subcategories of Theater and all countries around the world. If we know the subcategory and country, the analysis is more accurate.

Conclusion: The theater categrory should do the funding campaign between May and June because there were over 200 successful pledged or funded. The worst time for funding were between November and December only 91 successful. The failed pledged numbers were the same for all months around 40 and 50. And also the canceled pledged numbers were 3 or 4 each month. The reason failed and canceled numbers may be asked high fundings or regions. Therefore, May and June are good months to do the theater category funding campaign.

2. Louise’s play Fever came close came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. 
How many other Kickstarter campaigns were able to do this as well? In this challenge, 
you’ll conduct a data analysis to answer this question and determine whether the length of a campaign contributes to its ultimate success or failure.

Data Limitation: The data analysis were included plays around the world. If we know where it plays, then we can get country data to do analysis

Conclusion:   Louise’s play Fever should do the funding campaign for $5,000 or less because the successful pledged or funded more 72%. If the play Fever needs more funding, then the maximum fund can be raised $20,000 and the chance is 50-50. If looking at the data table, the most count of plays were below $20,000. Any plays above $20,000 gets very high chance failure. There were total 6 plays between $30,000 and $45,000 and successful pledged 67%, but the data were very small compare to the total of plays in range 0 to $20,000 to tell the truth. Therefore, Louise' play should not run the funding campaign more $20,000.
